# Socket Listener Sample App

Open a socket to a given server and keep it open.
Read line by line from the socket and show the read data in the app.

Can be used as a simple push message replacement for a local WiFi.

*This is a demo!*

Any real world app should start/stop the listening services in response
to WiFi connectivity to save battery.
